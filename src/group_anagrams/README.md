# group_anagrams

This was a code challenge given me in Dev 2025 as part of an interview with 
Fox Studios.  It was one of a group of five challenges.  It was later evaulated
in a panel interview zoom meeting with Crystal Maginnes, Aaron Stephanus and Natalia Buscaglia.

The instructions were very brief:
> **Task 5 – Hashing & Grouping**
> Implement group_anagrams(words: list[str]) -> list[list[str]].

That was all!  ChatGpt helped me infer what they were really after.
