# most_common_word

This was a code challenge given me in Dev 2025 as part of an interview with 
Fox Studios.  It was one of a group of five challenges.  It was later evaulated
in a panel interview zoom meeting with Crystal Maginnes, Aaron Stephanus and Natalia Buscaglia.

The instructions were very brief:
> Implement most_common_word(text: str, stopwords: set[str] | None = None) -> str | None.

That was all!  ChatGpt helped me infer what they were really after.
